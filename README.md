# Backend Job Trackinig Web API
- This is a webapi for the jobtracking app specified in the Datacom test requirements
- Git clone the repo and open the project in VS2022.
- Run the project and you should see the Swagger UI open in a browser.
- If this does not happen open a browser and type this in the url http://localhost:5275/swagger/index.html.
- This app is using an in memory db and so no data exists when the Web API first run's and no data is retained after the Web API is closed.

  ## Assumptions
  - No authentication and authorisation is required
  - No unit tests are required
  - The Web API will be run on a local PC and not in a cloud server
